# Real-Time Face Recognition & Access Control System

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on implementing a secure, real-time facial recognition system with access control logic. It uses deep learning and computer vision technologies to identify authorized users and manage entry permissions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (FaceNet)
- Flask
- Docker
- PostgreSQL

## 💡 Key Features
- Real-time face detection and matching
- User data stored securely in a PostgreSQL database
- Lightweight Flask API for facial verification
- Dockerized for portability and easy deployment

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Implementing and tuning facial recognition models
- Working with backend APIs and integrating machine learning
- Containerization with Docker and managing persistent volumes

**Status:** Completed (Mar 2024 – July 2025)
