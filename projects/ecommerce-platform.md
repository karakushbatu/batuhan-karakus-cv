# Distributed Microservice-Based E-Commerce Platform

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a scalable and modular e-commerce backend system built using a microservice architecture. Each service handles a specific business domain, communicating via gRPC for high performance and reliability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js & Express.js
- Go (Golang) with gRPC
- Docker
- GitLab CI/CD
- RESTful APIs
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL (optional for future extension)

## 💡 Key Features
- Authentication and user management service
- Product and inventory microservice
- Order processing and payment integration
- gRPC-based inter-service communication
- Dockerized deployment with GitLab CI/CD pipelines

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Designing scalable backend systems using microservices
- gRPC protocol for efficient communication between services
- Managing service orchestration using Docker
- Automating build and deployment pipelines with CI/CD

**Status:** In Progress (2025 – ?)
