# RTOS-Based Thread Scheduler on ARM Cortex-M

## 🔍 Overview
This project implements a lightweight real-time thread scheduler on an embedded ARM Cortex-M system using FreeRTOS. It manages multiple tasks and context switching in a preemptive real-time environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- ARM Cortex-M (STM32F4)
- FreeRTOS
- Keil uVision IDE

## 💡 Key Features
- Custom task scheduling and execution using FreeRTOS primitives
- Real-time task switching and interrupt handling
- Modular, testable design on STM32F4 development board
- Optimized for memory and timing constraints

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Embedded system development with FreeRTOS
- Writing efficient C code for resource-constrained environments
- Understanding of ISR (Interrupt Service Routines) and RTOS internals
- Debugging with Keil and real-time simulation

**Status:** Completed (Jan 2025 – Apr 2025)
